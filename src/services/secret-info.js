        title: 'Corellian freighters',
        text: 'Watching the original Star Wars trilogy, it was easy to believe that the Millennium Falcon was a one-of-a-kind spaceship. After all, while we saw plenty of X-wings and TIE fighters zipping through space, we never got a look at anything like another Falcon. But the truth is that Han Solo\'s beloved freighter was just one of many in the Corellian YT-1300 line, and to prove it, George Lucas slipped in several of them in the background during the prequels—including a brief shot of the Falcon herself, spotted docking at Coruscant long before Solo claimed ownership from Lando Calrissian.'

        title: 'Lucky dice in the Millennium Falcon',
        text: 'Even long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away, hanging dice were used as lucky charms. For proof, check out the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon, where a golden pair can be seen hanging in A New Hope (those little golden trinkets hanging above Luke and Obi-Wan)—and again in The Force Awakens, thanks to detail-oriented crew members who reportedly picked up a new set on eBay during filming. Lots of non-movie sources, from books to comics to novels, try to explain their presence…but let\'s just go with "George Lucas thought it\'d be funny" and move on.'

        title: 'Boba Fett unmasked',
        text: 'Officially, Star Wars fans didn\'t get their first look at Boba Fett with his helmet off until the second prequel, Attack of the Clones. But the guy who played Fett in the original films, Jeremy Bulloch, actually showed his face in The Empire Strikes Back. When another actor failed to show up for filming during the shoot, Bulloch stepped in to play an Imperial officer who drags Leia away while she\'s trying to warn Luke about Vader\'s trap in Bespin. Years later, Bulloch returned for another non-Fett cameo, playing the pilot who delivers Obi-Wan Kenobi, Bail Organa, and Yoda to Coruscant in Revenge of the Sith.'

        title: 'Potato asteroids',
        text: 'For years, rumors have persisted that the Empire Strikes Back effects crew, annoyed by Lucas\' almost impossible demands, decided to (ahem) strike back by using a potato and a sneaker as "asteroids" during a Millennium Falcon chase sequence. Years later, it was revealed that the potato story was actually true—an in-joke between workers who\'d developed countless asteroid designs only to be told that the end result looked like a certain starchy food.'

    {
        title: 'Klutzy Stormtrooper DNA',
        text: 'Hardcore Star Wars fans know about the goof-up that made it into the final cut of A New Hope, in which a Stormtrooper bumps his helmet on a door while trying to enter a room. Years later, George Lucas paid homage to the mistake when he had the character of Jango Fett—whose DNA was used to create the cloned Stormtrooper army—whack his head on the door as he climbs into his ship.'

    {
        title: 'Skywalker Sound on Coruscant',
        text: 'There\'s a lot going on in Coruscant, making it easy for Lucas to sneak in the logo for his Skywalker Sound company during a brief shot of the city that takes place roughly 20 minutes into Attack of the Clones. Take a look at the blue, circular logo at the top-right section of the image above. Now take a look at the logo for Skywalker Sound.'
